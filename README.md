# SentinelAI-The-AI-Guard
SentinelAI is a local first PII anonymization and evaluation framework built to protect sensitive data in text files (txt, csv, JSON) without relying on external or cloud-based services. It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), rule-based systems, and context aware logic to deliver a robust, efficient, and explainable anonymization pipeline.
